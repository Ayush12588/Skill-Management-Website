# Day Zero

Day Zero is a discipline-first habit tracker built for people who want honesty, not fake streaks.

Most habit trackers only record success.
Day Zero records **effort, failure, and consistency**.

## What makes it different

- Daily tasks must be marked as **completed** or **missed**
- Missed tasks are recorded, not ignored
- No silent skipping of days
- Progress is based on honesty, not perfection

## Core Features

- Custom journeys (goal, duration, daily tasks)
- Daily task check (✅) and fail (❌) system
- Automatic streak and progress tracking
- Visible failed days
- Motivational discipline quotes
- Secure authentication

## Why I built this

I wanted a tracker that doesn’t lie to me.

This project documents my own front-end learning journey and reflects my belief that discipline is built by showing up honestly every day.
